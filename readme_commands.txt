Readme Structure
1. Project Title

2.  Overview
A clear explanation of:
    -What problem this data engineering pipeline solves.
    -The business case / scenario.
    -Brief description of the datasets and goals.

3. Architecture
A diagram or description of your end-to-end data pipeline:
    -Data ingestion source(s)
    -Storage (like S3, Data Lake, SQL DB)
    -Processing layer (ETL tools like Glue, ADF, PySpark)
    -Reporting/dashboard tools (Power BI, QuickSight)
    -Optional: embed an architecture diagram here.

4. Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, AWS S3, AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, SQL Server, Power BI, Git

5. Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Python 3.9, AWS CLI configured, SQL Server installed

How to run: e.g
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
cd project-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/etl_pipeline.py

6. Data Sources e.g
customer_data.csv — customer information
transactions.csv — transaction records

Include:
Where the data comes from - Could come from a CRM system like Salesforce, or exported from a customer database. 
The schema of key tables/files.

Column Name	    Data Type	Description
customer_id	    INTEGER	    Unique identifier for each customer
first_name	    STRING	    Customer’s first name
last_name	    STRING	    Customer’s last name

7. Pipeline Workflow e.g.
Extract data from S3 bucket.
Load into staging tables in SQL Server.
Transform with SQL scripts.
Publish Power BI dashboard.

Architecture	                                                            
The high-level design/blueprint of your entire system or solution.	
Focuses on how components, services, and tools are organized and connected.	
Includes data sources, processing layers, storage, analytics, dashboards, and cloud/on-prem infrastructure.	
Answers “what technologies, services, and connections does this system use and how are they structured?”	
Often visualized as a diagram of systems and services.	

[POS System] → [AWS S3] → [Glue ETL] → [SQL Server] → [Synapse DWH] → [Power BI Dashboard]

Pipeline Workflow
The step-by-step sequence of actions/data flow within your pipeline.
Focuses on what happens to the data at each step from source to destination.
Includes steps like extract, load, transform, validate, aggregate, and publish.
Answers “what does the pipeline actually do with the data, in what order, and how?”
Often visualized as a flowchart of pipeline tasks.

Extract → Load → Clean/Transform → Aggregate → Join → Load to DWH → Report


8. Usage (Optional as you need to publish your project)
Show users how to actually use your project in practice e.g.

1. How to Run a Python Script or Pipeline
2. Sample SQL Queries on Processed Data
3. How to Trigger a Cloud ETL Job
4. Sample Power BI Dashboard Filters
5. How to Use a CLI Command or API (if you built one)


9. Project Structure
This contains the directory structure of the project directory

10. Contributing
